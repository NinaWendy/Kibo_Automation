# Project: Operations and Customer Communication System

Summit E-commerce Ventures wants an Operations and Customer Communication System and they have contacted you with the following details:

## Project Overview:

We want to create an Operations and Customer Communications System using low-code/no-code tools for our e-commerce store. The goal of this system is to streamline our inventory tracking, product management, order processing and fulfillment, and effective communications with customers. We want to ensure real-time visibility into our stock levels and enhance our overall customer experience.

### Overview of our current process:

When new orders are received or when we restock products, we update the inventory records in our books to capture these changes and keep our inventory accurate.

To prevent overselling a product, when orders are placed for the product, we set aside the quantity ordered as a reservation.

We carry out an hourly check routine to see if any orders have been placed and a daily routine to check the inventory levels of each product so that we do not run out of products and place orders to the suppliers when the levels are critically low.

During the hourly routine checks, when new orders are received, a dedicated member of staff sends an order confirmation email with all necessary details about the order; including items ordered, quantities, prices, shipping address, and any applicable taxes or fees, to the customer who ordered to let them know that the order has been received and is being processed. Finally, an email is sent when the order has been shipped.

We need your help streamlining this process to make us work better and more efficiently.

### Your task:

Design Airtable database to include necessary tables for Inventory management and add the data. Finally, create a form for taking orders.

Provide data:
