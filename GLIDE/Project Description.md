# Project: Build an App with Glide

## Background

The CEO of MavenFlix wants to be able to see and monitor KPIs on the move with his mobile phone. You have been assigned a task by your supervisor, Bidemi, with the following details.

### Task Details

In addition to the dashboard you are currently building, we want to be able to monitor the company's KPIs on-the-go. The team should be able to visit a link and see all the important information they need on a mobile device.

This platform will enable team members to have near real-time visibility of our KPIs even while away from their computers or out of the office.

I suggest that you investigate Glideapps for this task and implement accordingly. Ensure to record a video explaining how to use your app.

Please aim to wrap this up by the end of the week.

### Deliverables

You are required to submit the following:

- A link to your Glide App
- A link to your video, hosted preferably on YouTube or Loom.
