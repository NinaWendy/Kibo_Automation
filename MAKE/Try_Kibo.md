    - If admissions challenge is not completed after 3 days, send a reminder
    - If admissions challenge is not completed after 7 days, send a final reminder
    - If admissions challenge is passed, send admissions notification to applicant and update status to admitted
    - If admissions challenge is failed, send admissions challenge retake notification and leave status at applied
    - If admitted after 3 days and not enrolled, send enrollment reminder to applicant
    - If applicant enrolls, update status to enrolled and send enrollment confirmed email.
