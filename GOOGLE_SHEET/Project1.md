The Email

`Hello Nina,`

`Welcome to the team! I'm happy to have you here.`

`For this week, I want you to spend some time digging into the subscription data. Our CEO is very worried that we are not doing enough to retain customers. With Netflix, Amazon Prime, and others competing for the same users, we need to understand how to remain competetive. I have been meaning to spend time analyzing the data, but there's too much on my plate. So I'm glad you can take this on.`

`Here are some of the questions I believe we need to answer.`

`What are the trends in subscription sign-ups over time?`
`What is the average duration of subscriptions before cancellation?`
`What percentage of customers have subscribed for 5 months or more consecutively?`
`What month had the highest subscriber retention, and the lowest?`
`If there are other questions you have after looking at the data, feel free to explore them as well.`

`As you do this, don't lose focus on our business goals which are:`

`Increase customer subscriptions`
`Increase customer retention rates`
`Please aim to wrap the initial version of this by the end of the week.`

`Regards, Bidemi`
